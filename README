The ads1298-breakout project is a break-out board for the Texas Instruments
ADS1298R BGA chip.

The board does not include electrical isolation, thus must not be used
with human subjects if connected to a computer connected to wall power.
External isolation can be added, see:

(Alternatively, a laptop running from battery may be okay).
